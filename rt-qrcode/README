Dalfry (aka VaibhaV Sharma <vaibhav@vaibhavsharma.com> )

Description
===========
- Written and tested with Racktables version 0.20.4

- This plugin requires (and includes) PHP QR Code library from here -
http://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net/

- The plugin prints a QR code image in a separate tab

- The QR code currently contains the serial number and only shows up for servers


INSTALLATION
============
- Copy rt-qrcode.php to the plugins directory
- Copy rt-qrcode directory to the plugins directory
- Navigate to an object (Server) and click on "QR Code" tab

FUTURE PLANS
============
- Add more object attributes in the QR code
- Include (in QR Code) a one-click URL to the object
- Ability to customize QR code data without changing php code
- Ability to dynamically specify QR code size (without changing pho code)


WISHFUL THINKING
================
- Use this plugin + Racktables API to enable a phone app that can scan QR codes to lookup objects

=========
CHANGELOG
=========
- 1/18/14 -
