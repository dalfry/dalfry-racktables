QR code printer plugin for Racktables
Dalfry (aka VaibhaV Sharma <vaibhav@vaibhavsharma.com> )

Description
===========
- The code requires (and includes) PHP QR Code library from here -
http://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net/

- The plugin prints a QR code for enabled object types in a separate tab

- The QR code currently only shows up for servers and contains the serial number in the code


INSTALLATION
============
- Copy rt-qrcode.php in the plugins directory
- Copy rt-qrcode directory in the plugins directory

FUTURE PLANS
============
- Ability to customize QR code data without changing php code
- Ability to dynamically specify QR code size (without changing pho code)
- Include (in QR Code) a one-click URL to the object

WISHFUL THINKING
================
- Use this plugin + Racktables API to enable a phone app that can scan QR codes to lookup objects


=========
CHANGELOG
=========
- 1/18/14 -
